# filrenaming-server
Basic PHP backend for renaming uploaded files

This is the backend of the file-renaming program which is a quick way of bulk-rename files into batches with sequential numbering.

## How to install
```
git clone https://github.com/svnoak/filrenaming-server.git
cd filrenaming-server
php -S localhost:7000
```

!IMPORTANT! The [client](https://github.com/svnoak/FiRE-CLIENT) looks for a server at port 7000, don't change it without changing it in the client.
